        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-6 text-purple-900">The Secret History of Herd Mentality (And Why You'd Probably Follow a Goat if Everyone Else Did)</h1>
        <div className="prose lg:prose-xl max-w-4xl mx-auto text-gray-800">
          <p>Picture this: you're walking through a crowd. Suddenly, the people ahead of you start veering left. No one says why. But like a good little sheep-human hybrid, you follow. Why? Because everyone else is doing it.</p>
          
          <p>Congratulations‚Äîyou've just experienced the very core of herd mentality.</p>
          
          <p>But where does this impulse come from? Why do we, highly-evolved primates with Wi-Fi and oat milk, still make decisions based on what the group is doing? And what does any of this have to do with party games and hypothetical goats?</p>
          
          <p>Let's take a wander through history, psychology, and pop culture to unpack the bizarre and brilliant logic of the herd.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-800">üß† The Brain Was Built for Belonging</h2>
          <p>Humans are social creatures. In fact, we're hypersocial. Our brains evolved to prioritize connection and safety within a group, because back in our caveman days, being the odd one out usually meant becoming a sabertooth snack.</p>
          
          <p>Sticking with the tribe = survival.<br />
          Wandering off alone = lunch.</p>
          
          <p>So we developed cognitive shortcuts. If everyone's running, you run. If everyone's eating the weird mushroom, you at least consider it. This instinct, while occasionally hilarious in modern times, helped us stay alive.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-800">üêê Goats, Cliff Jumps & Groupthink: Real-World Examples</h2>
          <p>Ever heard of that time in Turkey when 450 sheep followed one another off a cliff because the first few did? True story. The first 50 died. The rest landed on the fluffy pile of the ones before and survived (grim but fascinating).</p>
          
          <p>We may laugh at goats, but humans do this too‚Äîjust with better shoes.</p>
          
          <p>In the stock market, entire trends are fueled by herd behavior. Ever heard of FOMO investing?</p>
          
          <p>In fashion, we decide certain pants are cool again after ten years of calling them ugly (looking at you, low-rise jeans).</p>
          
          <p>In politics, movements surge when enough people start repeating the same message, even if it began with a single voice.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-800">üéâ Enter the Party Game That Exposes It All</h2>
          <p>That's where Herd Game comes in. On the surface, it looks like a simple party game. But underneath? It's a pure, chaotic simulation of human groupthink.</p>
          
          <p>Name a fruit.<br />
          You think "mango," but guess the herd will say "banana."<br />
          You go with "banana."<br />
          So does everyone else. You feel... weirdly validated?</p>
          
          <p>It's a game that rewards conformity and punishes originality. You don't win for being clever‚Äîyou win for being average. And somehow, that makes it even more fun.</p>
          
          <p>It turns out that trying to guess what everyone else thinks is both hilarious and kind of profound. It reveals how tuned in we are to group behavior, how much we second-guess our own instincts, and how deeply we care about fitting in‚Äîeven in a game.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-800">ü§î So... Would You Follow the Goat?</h2>
          <p>Maybe not literally (we hope). But metaphorically? Probably, yeah. Because in a world full of uncertainty, one of the safest instincts we have is "do what the group is doing."</p>
          
          <p>Sometimes it keeps us safe.<br />
          Sometimes it makes us cool.<br />
          Sometimes it has us all yelling "Pineapple!" at a game night.</p>
          
          <p>And honestly? That's the beauty of being human.
          We are wired for connection, and even our weirdest games reflect that.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-purple-800">TL;DR:</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>Herd mentality is evolutionary and very real.</li>
            <li>It affects everything from what we wear to how we vote.</li>
            <li>Herd Game is both a party game and a behavioral experiment in disguise.</li>
            <li>You probably would follow the goat.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>So next time you're playing and everyone answers "Paris" to "Most romantic city," don't resist it. Embrace your inner sheep. Just, you know... stay away from cliffs.</p>
