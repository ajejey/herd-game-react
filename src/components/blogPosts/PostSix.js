            Most of life rewards originality.
            Art? Be bold.
            Interviews? Stand out.
            Instagram? Be aesthetic.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            But what if we told you that being painfully average‚Äîblissfully, proudly, unremarkably normal‚Äîis exactly how you win?
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Welcome to the wild world of Herd Game, where you don't want the "right" answer, you want the most predictable one.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Let's talk strategy, psychology, and why embracing your inner normcore might just make you a champion.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">üéØ The Goal: Think Like the Herd</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Here's how the game works:
            You're asked something like:
            "What's the best pizza topping?"
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Now, you might think "goat cheese and caramelized onions."
            But what will everyone else say?
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Exactly. "Pepperoni."
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            The magic of Herd Game is this: you're not rewarded for being creative‚Äîyou're rewarded for being in sync. The most popular answer wins, and the odd one out gets the cow.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            So how do you win? You stop being you, and you start being us.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">üß† Step 1: Channel Your Inner Basic</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This is not the time for hot takes.
            It's not the time to show off your niche knowledge of jazz saxophonists or rare Pok√©mon.
            This is the time to become the average human.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Ask yourself:
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            What would the average person blurt out without thinking?
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            What would a teenager, a mom, and your uncle Bob all agree on?
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Because if you're thinking "Roosevelt Elk" for "Animal with horns," and everyone else writes "Goat," guess who's getting that lovely cow marker?
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">üëÄ Step 2: Read the Room (Literally)</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            In a live game, your competition is the room.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Your answers should reflect the current vibe:
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Playing with kids? Go silly.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Playing with coworkers? Go safe.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Playing with your chaotic friends? Honestly... maybe just write "chaos."
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Your job is not just to answer the prompt‚Äîit's to simulate the hive mind of your group. That's the real meta game.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">ü§ñ Step 3: Run the Internal Algorithm</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Your brain should look something like this:
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Prompt: "A mode of transport"<br />
            Actual answer: "Segway"<br />
            Better answer: "Bike"<br />
            Best answer: "Car"
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Car is boring. Car is safe. Car is what everyone's thinking.
            Car wins.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            This game doesn't care how smart you are.
            It cares how predictable you are.
            Which is weirdly hard, but also hilarious.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">üêÑ Step 4: Fear the Cow</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The cow is adorable but deadly. If your answer is the only one that's different from the rest, you get the dreaded Pink Cow. That means:
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            You lose a point.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            You're the official outcast of the round.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            You might be mocked (lovingly, of course).
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            So if you're ever stuck, just think:
            "What would the cow do?"
            And then don't do that.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">üèÜ Final Tip: The Herd Always Wins</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The irony of Herd Game is that it turns every "main character" into a background extra‚Äîand it's brilliant.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            You win not by being clever, but by being common.
            Not by standing out, but by melting in.
            It's groupthink as entertainment. And it's surprisingly cathartic.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">TL;DR:</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Forget originality. Embrace predictability.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Answer what everyone else is most likely to answer.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Don't think outside the box. Be the box.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Fear the cow.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Win by becoming the most average human alive (temporarily, of course).
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            So next time someone asks, "What's a popular dog name?" don't overthink it.
            Just say "Buddy."
            Because Buddy is basic.
            Buddy is safe.
            And Buddy gets you that point.
          </p>
