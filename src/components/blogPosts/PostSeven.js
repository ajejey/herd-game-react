          <p className="mb-4">
            So you've just finished a round of Herd Game.
            The answers are revealed.
            Laughter erupts.
            Someone is groaning over the cow.
            And then‚Äîit begins.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            "Wait, WHO put 'toaster' for 'household appliance you can't live without'?!"
            "How is 'air conditioner' not the obvious answer?"
            "You people are wild."
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Welcome to the Real Game:
            The post-round chaos where friendships are tested, logic is thrown out the window, and everyone defends their "perfectly reasonable" answer like a PhD thesis.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            And honestly?
            It's the best part.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            This is when the game goes from trivia to courtroom drama.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            People start building cases:
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            "Technically, a kettle is more essential than a microwave if you think about tea culture."
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            "I thought you'd all say 'window'! It lets in light! LIGHT, people!"
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Everyone's trying to justify their unique logic, and it's hilariously unhinged.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Suddenly, the chill friend becomes a philosopher. The quiet one goes full debate club. And the one with the cow? They're crafting their redemption arc.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">ü§ù The Strange Joy of Being Outvoted</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Here's the weird twist:
            Even when your answer gets you booed, it's still fun.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            There's something weirdly bonding about:
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Being the only person who said "Parrot" for "Animal you'd want as a sidekick."
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Realizing everyone else said "Dog."
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            And now you must defend your parrot till your last breath.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            This shared absurdity creates inside jokes that last beyond the game.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            "Remember when Rachel thought parrot was a better sidekick than a dog?"
            "ICONIC."
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">üß† It's a Peek into Everyone's Brain</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The post-round debate is like opening a tiny window into how your friends think.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            You start noticing patterns:
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Tim always overthinks the question.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Priya answers like she's on Family Feud.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Sam‚Ä¶ is just chaos.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            And somehow, this game of silly questions becomes a map of your group's collective mind.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            It's weirdly wholesome.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">üêÑ Why the Cow is the MVP</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Let's be honest:
            The pink cow is the main character.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Getting the cow is a badge of shame and glory.
            It's the moment that gets the biggest laugh, the loudest "WHAAAAT?", the most debate.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            In fact, the cow might be the only time being wrong feels better than being right.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">üéâ Tip: Lean Into the Mayhem</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If you're playing Herd Game and skipping the post-round chat‚Äîyou're missing half the joy.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Here's how to make the most of it:
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Pause after every round to ask: "Okay, who said that?"
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Let people explain their weird logic‚Äîit's comedy gold.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Celebrate the cow. They're the real MVP.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Take notes‚Äîyou'll never look at your friends the same way again.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">TL;DR:</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Herd Game is fun.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            But arguing about the answers afterward? That's where the magic is.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            It's messy, it's funny, and it turns a game into a full-blown group therapy session with punchlines.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Next time you play, don't just flip to the next card.
            Savor the chaos.
            Ask the questions.
            Start the fight.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Because the round may end‚Ä¶
            But the debate?
            That's forever.
