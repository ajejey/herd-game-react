            You've got your herd.
            Now you want to host a night that's legendary.
            One of those "remember that game night??" kind of nights.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Here's the good news:
            Hosting a Herd Mentality night is low-effort, high-chaos fun.
            And this post will help you milk it for everything it's worth (pun very intended üêÑ).

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">üéØ Step 1: Set the Vibe, Not the Rules</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The beauty of this game is that it doesn't need intense setup.
            But what it does need is the right energy.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Pick a cozy space: couches, cushions, maybe even floor seating. You want people leaning in and laughing.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Snacks everywhere: Sweet, salty, spicy. Something for every mood swing the cow causes.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            No pressure: Remind people this isn't about being smart‚Äîit's about thinking like the group, even if it's illogical.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            "It's not about being right. It's about being basic."
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">üì¶ Step 2: Open the Box, Toss the Instructions</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Seriously.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Here's all you need to explain:
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            "You'll hear a question.
            Everyone writes what they think most people will say.
            If your answer matches the majority, you get a point.
            If you're the odd one out‚Äîyou get the cow. üêÑ"
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            That's it. Boom. Game on.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">üé§ Step 3: Choose Your Host Wisely</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The question-reader matters.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Pick someone who can:
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Read with drama.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Laugh at the absurd answers.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Stir the pot just enough.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            If you've got someone with stand-up energy, let them be your chaos conductor.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            And rotate hosts each round for more fun!
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">üßÉ Step 4: Add a Little Flavor (Optional but Fun)</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Want to spice it up? Try these:
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Theme Nights: Pajama party? Farmcore? Everyone wears a horned headband?
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Answer Rounds Out Loud: Instead of writing, everyone shouts answers at once. It's chaotic, hilarious, and fast.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Punishments for the Cow: 5-second dance? Dramatic apology to the group? Moo loudly?
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            You're not just playing.
            You're building a vibe.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">üì∏ Step 5: Capture the Chaos</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Some of the best moments are:
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            The split-second silence before an outrageous answer is revealed.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Someone shouting "WHAT?! You all said watermelon??"
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            The face of the person who gets the cow for the fourth time.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Snap photos. Record videos. Post your group's best debates or worst answers.
            This is pure internet gold.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Bonus: Create a "Cow Wall of Fame" after each game night. Immortalize the most unhinged answers.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">üêÆ Final Tips for a Herd-Perfect Night</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Keep rounds short: 12‚Äì15 questions is enough to keep the energy up.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Play in teams if your group is big: It's even funnier when groups argue internally.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Rotate players in and out if some want to chill between rounds.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            End on a high‚Äîleave people wanting more, not tired.
          </p>
