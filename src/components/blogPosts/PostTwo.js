                        Herd Game taps into a fascinating aspect of human psychology: our desire to belong and think like others.
                        This phenomenon, often called "herd mentality" or "groupthink," is deeply ingrained in our social nature.
                        But why do we find it so entertaining in a game setting?

                    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">The Comfort of Consensus</h3>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                        There's a certain comfort in knowing that others think the same way we do. When your answer matches with the majority in Herd Game,
                        you experience a small dopamine rush – a reward for being "part of the group." This psychological reward system makes the game inherently satisfying.
                    </p>

                    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">The Challenge of Prediction</h3>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                        Herd Game isn't just about giving your own opinion – it's about predicting what others will say.
                        This requires empathy and social intelligence, skills that humans have evolved to value highly.
                        Successfully predicting the group's answer feels like a social victory.
                    </p>

                    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">The Humor in Differences</h3>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                        Paradoxically, some of the most entertaining moments in Herd Game come when someone gives a wildly different answer.
                        These moments of divergence create humor and spark conversations about why we think differently.
                        The game creates a safe space to explore both our similarities and our differences.
                    </p>
