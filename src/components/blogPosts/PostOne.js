          Virtual game nights have become increasingly popular, allowing friends and family to connect regardless of distance. 
          Herd Game is perfect for these gatherings, but hosting a successful virtual game night requires some planning. 
          Here are five tips to ensure your next virtual game night is a hit:

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">1. Send Invitations with Clear Instructions</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Make sure everyone knows how to join your Herd Game session. Send out invitations with the room code, 
          start time, and any other relevant information. Consider creating a calendar invite to help everyone remember.
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">2. Test Your Setup Beforehand</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Nothing kills the mood faster than technical difficulties. Test your internet connection, 
          microphone, and camera before the game begins. Encourage your guests to do the same.
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">3. Plan for Different Group Sizes</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Herd Game works well with various group sizes, but the dynamics change depending on how many players you have. 
          With smaller groups (4-6 players), rounds go quickly and everyone gets more turns. 
          Larger groups (10+ players) create more diverse answers and interesting discussions.
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">4. Consider a Theme Night</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Make your game night more engaging by adding a theme. This could be as simple as everyone wearing a certain color 
          or as elaborate as a full costume party. Themes add an extra layer of fun and can make for great screenshots.
        </p>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">5. Have Backup Activities</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          While Herd Game is entertaining, it's always good to have backup plans. 
          Consider having another game ready to go if you want to switch things up after a few rounds.
        </p>
