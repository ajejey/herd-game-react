                <p>
                  Herd Game is an online multiplayer party game inspired by popular board games where players try to match their answers with the group. 
                  The goal is to think like the "herd" â€“ giving answers that match what most other players are thinking. 
                  It's perfect for virtual game nights, team building activities, family gatherings, and any social event.

                <p>
                  Herd Game works best with 4 or more players, but there's no upper limit! You can play with small groups of friends or large parties. 
                  The more players you have, the more interesting the results can be as you try to predict what the majority will answer.

                <p>
                  To win Herd Game, you need to be the first player to reach 8 points without holding the special marker (the Pink Cow). 
                  You earn points by giving answers that match with the majority of other players. If your answer is unique or in the minority, 
                  you won't earn points for that round.

                <p>
                  The Pink Cow is a special marker given to the player with the most unique answer in a round. 
                  If you're holding the Pink Cow, you cannot win the game even if you reach 8 points. 
                  To get rid of the Pink Cow, you need to give an answer that matches with the majority in a subsequent round.

                <p>
                  Yes, players have 30 seconds to submit their answers for each question. This keeps the game moving at a good pace 
                  and prevents players from overthinking their responses. If you don't answer within the time limit, you won't earn points for that round.

                  If you lose connection during a game, Herd Game will attempt to reconnect you automatically. 
                  If that fails, you can rejoin using the same room code and username. The game saves your progress, 
                  so you won't lose your points or game status when reconnecting.
